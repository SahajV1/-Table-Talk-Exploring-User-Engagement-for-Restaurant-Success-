# Table-Talk-Exploring-User-Engagement-for-Restaurant-Success-
Project Overview
In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

Research Objectives
Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and review count/average star rating.
Analyze the impact of sentiment on review count and average star rating.
Identify time trends in user engagement.
Hypothesis
Higher levels of user engagement (more reviews, tips, and check-ins) correlate with higher review counts and ratings for restaurants.
Positive sentiment expressed in reviews and tips contributes to higher overall ratings and review counts for restaurants.
Consistent engagement over time is positively associated with sustained business success for restaurants.
Data Overview
Dataset: Subset of Yelp with information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.
Files: The dataset consists of five JSON files - business.json, review.json, user.json, tip.json, and checkin.json.
Storage: JSON files are stored in an SQLite database for easy retrieval of data.
Key Insights
Out of 150k businesses, 35k are open restaurants. 4-star ratings peak engagement, declining at 5 stars due to saturation or selectivity.
Elite users drive reviews and loyalty. Peak hours (4 pm â€“ 1 am) highlight optimal staffing and resource times for efficiency.
